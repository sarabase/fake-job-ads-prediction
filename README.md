# Fake Job Ads Prediction
This repository contains the code used in a Kaggle competition with the purpose of predicting whether a job posting ad is real or fake. The competition was part of the Machine Learning course work from the MSc in Fundamental Principles of Data Science at Universitat de Barcelona. We ended up placing second in the classroom competition.
